            If you are using Git for version control, you need a Gitignore file to
            ignore all files that don’t matter and shouldn’t be in your git repository.
            Think of your virtual environment and all the .pyc files. Those are both
            generated and can be generated by anyone that has access to your code.
            Therefore, it’s unnecessary to add those to your repository. There are a lot
            of different file types and specific folders that you don’t need. Even
            outside of Django. Think about your personal settings in VS Code (if you use
            that). Here is a list which covers all things that you can ignore through
            gitignore for every Django project you start. Put this list in the root of
            your Django project and call it .gitignore (yes, with the dot!).
